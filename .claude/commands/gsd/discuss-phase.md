<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — researcher and planner will use CONTEXT.md to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**How it works:**
1. Load prior context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, prior CONTEXT.md files)
2. Scout codebase for reusable assets and patterns
3. Analyze phase — skip gray areas already decided in prior phases
4. Present remaining gray areas — user selects which to discuss
5. Deep-dive each selected area until satisfied
6. Create CONTEXT.md with decisions that guide research and planning

**Output:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` — decisions clear enough that downstream agents can act without asking the user again
</objective>

<execution_context>
Workflow files are loaded on-demand in the <process> section below — not upfront.
Do not pre-load any workflow files before reading the mode routing instructions.
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent — `vscode_askquestions` is the VS Code Copilot implementation of the same interactive question API.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op` and roadmap/state tool calls.
</context>

<process>
**Mode routing:**
```bash
DISCUSS_MODE=$(gsd-sdk query config-get workflow.discuss_mode 2>/dev/null || echo "discuss")
```

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"assumptions"`:
Read and execute `C:/Users/patry/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/CIDM6330-Spring2026-Patrick-Perez/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase-assumptions.md` end-to-end.

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"discuss"` (or unset, or any other value):
Read and execute `C:/Users/patry/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/CIDM6330-Spring2026-Patrick-Perez/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md` end-to-end.

**MANDATORY:** Read the appropriate workflow file BEFORE taking any action. The objective and success_criteria sections in this command file are summaries — the workflow file contains the complete step-by-step process with all required behaviors, config checks, and interaction patterns. Do not improvise from the summary.

**Lazy loading:** `templates/context.md` is loaded inside the `write_context` step of the active workflow. `discuss-phase-power.md` is loaded inside `discuss-phase.md` when `--power` is detected. Do not load either here.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Prior context loaded and applied (no re-asking decided questions)
- Gray areas identified through intelligent analysis
- User chose which areas to discuss
- Each selected area explored until satisfied
- Scope creep redirected to deferred ideas
- CONTEXT.md captures decisions, not vague vision
- User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
