<purpose>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans. Optionally repairs auto-fixable issues.
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair`, `--backfill`, or `--context` flags are present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
BACKFILL_FLAG=""
CONTEXT_MODE=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
if arguments contain "--backfill"; then
  BACKFILL_FLAG="--backfill"
fi
if arguments contain "--context"; then
  CONTEXT_MODE="true"
fi
```

If `CONTEXT_MODE` is set, jump to the `context_check` step and skip the
integrity validation steps. The two modes are orthogonal — context utilization
has nothing to do with `.planning/` directory health.
</step>

<step name="context_check">
**Run only when `--context` is set.**

The model running this workflow self-reports the current session's
approximate `tokensUsed` and the active model's `contextWindow`. Use the values
visible in your runtime (Claude Code's `/context` slash command output, or the
model's own session telemetry). If the runtime exposes neither, prompt the user
once via AskUserQuestion for both numbers.

**TEXT_MODE fallback:** when `text_mode` is true (config or `--text` flag) the
runtime is non-Claude (Codex, Gemini, etc.) and `AskUserQuestion` is not
available — replace the prompt with a plain-text two-question sequence
("Approximate tokens used? Context window size?") and read the answers as
plain text from the user's response.

```bash
gsd-sdk query validate.context \
  --tokens-used "$TOKENS_USED" \
  --context-window "$CONTEXT_WINDOW"
```

The query prints a one-line status (`Context utilization: NN% (state)`) plus
a recommendation line for the warning and critical states. Print the SDK
output verbatim and end the workflow — do **not** mix in `.planning/`
health output, the two modes are independent diagnostics.
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
gsd-sdk query validate.health $REPAIR_FLAG $BACKFILL_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used

<step name="format_output">
**Format and display results:**

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD Health Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | BROKEN
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Info: N
```

**If repairs were performed:**
```
## Repairs Performed

- ✓ config.json: Created with defaults
- ✓ STATE.md: Regenerated from roadmap
```

**If errors exist:**
```
## Errors

- [E001] config.json: JSON parse error at line 5
  Fix: Run /gsd-health --repair to reset to defaults

- [E002] PROJECT.md not found
  Fix: Run /gsd-new-project to create
```

**If warnings exist:**
```
## Warnings

- [W002] STATE.md references phase 5, but only phases 1-3 exist
  Fix: Review STATE.md manually before changing it; repair will not overwrite an existing STATE.md

- [W005] Phase directory "1-setup" doesn't follow NN-name format
  Fix: Rename to match pattern (e.g., 01-setup)
```

**If info exists:**
```
## Info

- [I001] 02-implementation/02-01-PLAN.md has no SUMMARY.md
  Note: May be in progress
```

**Footer (if repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used):**
```
---
N issues can be auto-repaired. Run: /gsd-health --repair
```
</step>

<step name="offer_repair">
**If repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used:**

Ask user if they want to run repairs:

```
Would you like to run /gsd-health --repair to fix N issues automatically?
```

If yes, re-run with --repair flag and display results.
</step>

<step name="verify_repairs">
**If repairs were performed:**

Re-run health check without --repair to confirm issues are resolved:

```bash
gsd-sdk query validate.health
```

Report final status.

<repair_actions>

| Action | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| createConfig | Create config.json with defaults | None |
| resetConfig | Delete + recreate config.json | Loses custom settings |
| regenerateState | Create STATE.md from ROADMAP structure when it is missing | Loses session history |
| addNyquistKey | Add workflow.nyquist_validation: true to config.json | None — matches existing default |
| backfillMilestones | Synthesize missing MILESTONES.md entries from `.planning/milestones/vX.Y-ROADMAP.md` snapshots | None — additive only; triggered by `--backfill` flag |

**Not repairable (too risky):**
- PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md content
- Phase directory renaming
- Orphaned plan cleanup

</repair_actions>

<stale_task_cleanup>
**Windows-specific:** Check for stale Claude Code task directories that accumulate on crash/freeze.
These are left behind when subagents are force-killed and consume disk space.

When `--repair` is active, detect and clean up:

```bash
# Check for stale task directories (older than 24 hours)
TASKS_DIR="C:/Users/patry/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/CIDM6330-Spring2026-Patrick-Perez/.claude/tasks"
if [ -d "$TASKS_DIR" ]; then
  STALE_COUNT=$( (find "$TASKS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +1 2>/dev/null || true) | wc -l )
  if [ "$STALE_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Found $STALE_COUNT stale task directories in C:/Users/patry/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/CIDM6330-Spring2026-Patrick-Perez/.claude/tasks/"
    echo "   These are leftover from crashed subagent sessions."
    echo "   Run: rm -rf C:/Users/patry/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/CIDM6330-Spring2026-Patrick-Perez/.claude/tasks/*  (safe — only affects dead sessions)"
  fi
fi
```

Report as info diagnostic: `I002 | info | Stale subagent task directories found | Yes (--repair removes them)`
</stale_task_cleanup>
