[Harry Percival and Bob Gregory's Code Repository for the Book](https://github.com/cosmicpython/code.git)
While the Percival and Gregory Book is older now, it has good concepts in it and can be reviewed for free at [Cosmic Python](https://www.cosmicpython.com/).

`git clone --branch chapter_01_domain_model https://github.com/cosmicpython/code.git`

# Components of this Repo:
* [Acme](acme/README.MD) - Acme crew scheduling example. (updated in 2024)
* [APP](APP/README.MD) - Arhictecture Patterns in Python - Percival and Gregory
* [APP2023](APP/README.MD) - Arhictecture Patterns in Python - Percival and Gregory with some adjustments
* [Barky](Barky/README.MD) - a derivative of [Dane Hillard's Bark example](https://github.com/daneah/practices-of-the-python-pro), which has been transformed to follow along with Percival and Gregory's material. This is now optional, but still a useful guide.
* [Docs](docs/README.MD) - Course readings are here.
* [Testing](Testing/README.MD) - Separate materials on testing in Python.
* [PyTesting](Testing/PyTesting/README.MD) - pytest basics. We will not use PyTest, but it is very popular, so I didn't want to skip it.
* [MDN Django Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) - A good overview and tutorial for Django.
* [Django Girls Tutorial](tutorials/django-girls-tutorial/) - Another good primer on Django.

## Visual Studio Code Python Extension
It may become necessary for you to encourage the Python and Pylance extensions on how to find your virtual environment in VSCode.

The following can be added to a 'settings.json' file to accompany your project:

`"python.pythonPath": "/my/project/path/.venv/bin/python",`

## PyPi Packages
PyPi packages used:
* setuptools
* pytest
* coverage

## Percival's First Book on TDD

## Regarding Barky
There are four branches related to Barky that show the progression in Barky in consideration of the design principles we are studying.

You can see these branches with the `git branch` command.

## More on Architecture

The [docs](docs/README.MD) folder contains several files with supplemental and foundational knowledge for the course.
